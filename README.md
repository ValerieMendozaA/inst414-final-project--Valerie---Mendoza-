# Steam Game Sales Prediction Pipeline ðŸŽ®

Hi! This project is about predicting how well a video game will sell on Steam using a full data science pipeline. It goes from raw data to clean visuals, and everything is handled through code just run one file and it walks through the whole process.

## What the Code Does

When you run `main.py`, hereâ€™s what happens:

1. Uses the Steam dataset you provide  
2. Cleans and processes the data  
3. Trains a linear regression model  
4. Evaluates the model using MSE and RÂ²  
5. Creates visualizations that show insights into game performance

## Project Structure

- `etl/` â€“ handles extraction, transformation, and loading of the data  
- `analysis/` â€“ runs modeling and evaluation  
- `vis/` â€“ generates all charts and visuals  
- `data/` â€“ contains reference tables and output folders  
- `logs/` â€“ stores logs for each pipeline run  
- `main.py` â€“ this is the file that runs everything

## How to Run It

1. **Install the required Python packages**  
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset manually
The dataset is too large to include in GitHub; I had to download it myself:

Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/FronkonGames/steam-games-dataset/blob/main/games.csv

After downloading, rename the file to:

steam_games.csv


Then place it inside this folder:

data/extracted/


Run the pipeline
Once the dataset is in the right place, just run:

python main.py


Itâ€™ll go through the whole pipeline â€” from cleaning the data to training the model and generating visualizations. Youâ€™ll find the outputs in the data/outputs/ folder.
